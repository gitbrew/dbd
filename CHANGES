1.50: May 20 2013: Finally made the Makefile crossbuild friendly.

1.20: Apr 18 2012: Made a lot of changes to shift dbd from a primarily stand-
  alone tool to one that can easily interoperate with any framework you throw
  it into (works great with bindshell.it.cx/ohdae's Intersect post-exploitat-
  ion framework.
      -Makefile can now cross-compile windows binaries from a BackTrack or
       similar development environment.
      -Various and sundry insignificant changes designed to allow better
       integration with other tools.

1.00: Apr 5 2012: Shamelessly ripped from unmaintained sbd-1.37
      -Added Romulan Cloaking Technology for *nix
